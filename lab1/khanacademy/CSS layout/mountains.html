            <p>The <strong>mountains</strong> are large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, typically having a peak or summit. They are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. Mountains are often characterized by steep slopes, a significant height difference, and rugged terrain. Some mountains are part of larger mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas or the Andes, and others exist as isolated peaks, like Mount Fuji in Japan.</p>
            <p>
            Mountains are important natural features, serving as barriers for weather, creating climates and ecosystems, and providing a source of fresh water from melting snow. They also have cultural and spiritual significance in many societies. The study of mountains, including their formation, distribution, and properties, is called orography.
